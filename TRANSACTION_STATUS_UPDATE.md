# Testing the Updated Transaction Status System

## What Changed
The system now processes the immediate response from Airtel Money disbursement API and sets the transaction status based on the response:

- **Success Response**: `success: true` + `status: "TS"` → Transaction marked as `COMPLETED`
- **Failed Response**: `success: false` or `status: "TF"` → Transaction marked as `FAILED`  
- **Processing Response**: Other status codes → Transaction marked as `PROCESSING`

## Example Airtel Money Response
```json
{
    "data": {
        "transaction": {
            "reference_id": "10000280410",
            "airtel_money_id": "disbursement-XFMOJ26M4M-WD2025070910161",
            "id": "WD2025070910161",
            "status": "TS"
        }
    },
    "status": {
        "response_code": "DP00900001001",
        "code": "200",
        "success": true,
        "result_code": "ESB000010",
        "message": "Business Disbursement Partner transaction of KES 764 has been successfully completed"
    }
}
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Test Withdrawal Processing

#### Create a User
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/users
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "password123",
  "msisdn": "254712345678"
}
```

#### Add Balance (Create and Process Deposit)
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/transactions/deposit
{
  "userId": 1,
  "amount": 1000.00,
  "msisdn": "254712345678",
  "description": "Test deposit"
}

POST http://localhost:3000/transactions/deposit/{transactionId}/process
```

#### Create Withdrawal
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/transactions/withdrawal
{
  "userId": 1,
  "amount": 500.00,
  "msisdn": "254712345678",
  "description": "Test withdrawal"
}
```

#### Process Withdrawal
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/transactions/withdrawal/{transactionId}/process
```

### 3. Expected Behavior

When you process the withdrawal:

1. **If Airtel Money returns success** (`success: true`, `status: "TS"`):
   - Transaction status → `COMPLETED`
   - User balance reduced by withdrawal amount
   - Response includes Airtel Money ID and reference ID

2. **If Airtel Money returns failure** (`success: false` or `status: "TF"`):
   - Transaction status → `FAILED`
   - User balance unchanged
   - Error details stored

3. **If Airtel Money returns processing** (other status):
   - Transaction status → `PROCESSING`
   - User balance unchanged until final confirmation

### 4. Verify Results

#### Check Transaction Status
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/transactions/{transactionId}
```

#### Check User Balance
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/users/{userId}/balance
```

#### List All Transactions
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/transactions?userId={userId}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users get instant status updates
2. **Accurate Balance**: Balance only changes for successful transactions
3. **Error Handling**: Failed transactions are properly marked
4. **Audit Trail**: All Airtel Money response details are stored
5. **Real-time Updates**: No need to wait for separate webhooks

## Production Considerations

- The system still supports webhook callbacks for additional confirmation
- Consider implementing retry logic for network failures
- Add monitoring for transaction status distribution
- Implement alerting for high failure rates
